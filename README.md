# WikinHistory

Allows users to get an important events in history - based on month and day - through a simple and interactive interface.

Also, this is a rewrite of [WikiDay](https://www.github.com/melogtm/wikiday) in Spring Ecosystem. 

## Requirements

For building and running the application you need:

- [JDK 17](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase/jdk17-archive-downloads.html)

## Running the application locally

There are several ways to run a Spring Boot application on your local machine. One way is to execute the `main` method in the `com.melogtm.wikinhistory.WikinhistoryApplication` class from your IDE.

Alternatively you can use the [Spring Boot Maven plugin](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/html/build-tool-plugins-maven-plugin.html) like so:

```shell
# change to ./mvnw.cmd or ./mvnw if you don't have maven installed
mvn package 

mvn spring-boot:run
```
